# xnat_pbs_jobs/7T

Contains subdirectories of code (bash scripts and Python 3 code) for running
pipelines for the HCP 7T project.

Generally speaking there are subdirectories for each pipeline that needs 
to be run and each package that needs to be created after all the pipelines
are run.

There is also a lib subdirectory containing Python 3 modules that are generally
useful across pipelines and package builds.
